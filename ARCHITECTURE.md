# ARCHITECTURE.md — Hawksnest (software-level)

How this repo is organized and why. Suite-level context: `C:\Code\ARCHITECTURE.md`. Working
instructions + production-breaking invariants: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Feature/dev/testing
overview: [README.md](README.md). Backlog: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

Hawksnest is the **odd one out** in the suite: a presentation layer over **Home Assistant**
(HA stays the brain), no backend of its own, no public ingress (LAN/Tailscale only), deliberately
excluded from the Dragonfly config broker and SSO (it authenticates directly to HA). It fronts
the thing that unlocks the house's doors — security posture outranks features here.

```

One repo, three deliverables:

## 1. Web SPA/PWA (`src/`)

React + TypeScript (Vite), Tailwind mapped onto PULSE CSS tokens (`src/theme/tokens.css` — a
**CSS port** of the design language, *not* the `design.pulse:pulse-ui` Gradle library; that's
Compose-only). Dark is the default; a light variant (`:root.light`) is opt-in via Settings →
Appearance. `src/store/theme.ts` owns the Dark/Light/System preference (persisted), toggles the
class on `<html>`, and an inline script in `index.html` applies it before first paint (no flash).
Channel hues intentionally shift between themes so a vivid accent still clears contrast on white.

| Area | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/` | The domain kernel. `cameraModel.ts` collapses ring-mqtt's split entities (`_live`/`_snapshot`/`_event` + selectors/ding/motion) into one logical camera; `cards.ts` maps HA domains → card components (**must never throw** — unknown domains render `GenericCard`); `resolve.ts` centralizes label/icon resolution (per-entity overrides go in `src/config/overrides.ts`, never in components) |
| `src/store/` | Client state: HA WebSocket connection, auth, entity registry, reconnect logic. The entity sink dedupes the Ring-vs-ring-mqtt double exposure centrally (`src/lib/dedupe.ts`, platform map from the registry): when both integrations expose the same light, the ring-platform twin is dropped so every consumer sees one entity per physical device |
| `src/screens/` + `src/cards/` + `src/components/` | Presentation; no raw hex — PULSE tokens only. Loading states use the shared `Skeleton` (one hairline-strong shimmer sweep — camera first-frame decode, history fetch); the dashboard arm discs activate via a channel fill-sweep, still non-optimistic (the sweep follows HA's echo, pinned in tests) |
| `src/config/` | Entity/room overrides |
| `public/` + service worker (vite config) | PWA shell. **The SW never caches `/api` and never touches the HA token** — offline = shell + Offline/Demo state, never stale entity data. Updates are **prompt**, not silent (`registerType:"prompt"`): `UpdateToast` (useRegisterSW) surfaces a "reload" prompt when a new shell is waiting, so a wall tablet that never navigates isn't stranded on a stale build |

Camera streaming: WebRTC negotiates over the existing `/api/websocket`; media flows UDP direct to
go2rtc. The live transport ladder (`LivePlayer`) is WebRTC → HLS → MJPEG → snapshot-poll: WebRTC
is gated on the camera's STREAM `supported_features` bit with **absent treated as "try"**
(`canStreamWebRtc` in `lib/cameraUrl.ts` — modern HA dropped the old `frontend_stream_type`
attribute, and a battery cam's entity churns attribute-less mid-negotiation), holds a 20 s
watchdog + "Connecting…" overlay for battery-camera wake, and the HLS tier resolves its
`camera/stream` URL **only when that tier is active** (an eager resolve wakes the camera twice)
with a 15 s bound in `haSource`. Tile age badges use `snapshotFreshnessMs` (`timestamp` attr →
`last_updated` → `last_changed`) — `last_changed` alone reads hours-stale on cameras. Recorded
playback = the last ~5 Ring events via the event-selector entity (not continuous VOD; a Frigate
seam exists in `cameraEvents.ts`, unused). The **timeline shows only playable recordings**
(Ring-style: every block is watchable) — the selector's ~5 on ring, clip-bearing events on
Frigate/demo; no history-derived markers. Scrubbing is **live**: `Timeline24h` streams the time
under the center playhead during a drag (`onScrub`, rAF-throttled) and the playhead is a true ms —
inside a kept clip the video seeks in real time (forward and reverse) at the in-clip offset
(`clipSeek.ts`, mirrored in `core/logic/ClipSeek.kt`; a ring clip's real span is learned from the
loaded media's duration since `endMs` arrives null), and release keeps playing from that moment.
Ring clip streams resolve through an explicit per-clip state machine (`RingClipState`:
resolving → ready/**failed**): a stream HA can't produce (15 s timeout, sleeping battery cam,
rotated-out event, playback error) surfaces as "Couldn't load this recording" **with a Retry** —
never a stuck loader — while a time with no kept recording shows the honest "no saved recording"
note over the snapshot. Rendered Ring-style — solid `effort`-blue blocks, a triangle playhead, a
dim "Live" region right of now, a "TODAY" header (`Timeline24h`) — over the tested
`timelineViewport` math.

## 2. Android app (`android/`, package `com.hawksnest`)

Kotlin/Compose, talks to HA directly over Tailscale with a long-lived token. Full guide:
`android/README.md`.

- `core/ha/` — HA WebSocket/REST client (the Kotlin analogue of the web store). **All user-facing
  control calls go through `ControlGate`** (via `ConnectionManager.control`): it is the crash-safety
  layer (a failed call becomes a message on the app-level snackbar, never an uncaught coroutine
  exception) and the honest-pending tracker (entity id held in `pendingControls` until HA echoes,
  the call fails, or a 30 s timeout reports "didn't respond"). Raw `callService` is reserved for
  screens that surface their own errors (lock keypad codes, Z-Wave maintenance).
- `core/logic/`, `core/automations/` — entity → domain-model mapping, automation surfaces.
  Includes the ring/ring-mqtt dedupe (`Dedupe.kt`, applied centrally at `HaSource`'s entity sink,
  mirroring the web) and the Devices sectioning model (`DeviceSections.kt`: per-room three-tier
  rhythm — FEATURED lock/climate/alarm cards, CONTROL rows with inline switches, READONLY rows).
- `ui/<feature>/` — home/rooms/area/devices/cameras/entity/history/automations/settings.
- **Camera live ladder** (`ui/cameras/CameraPlayer.kt`): recorded VOD (when scrubbed) →
  **go2rtc-direct** (Ring cams only) → HA WebRTC → HLS → MJPEG → snapshot. The go2rtc-direct
  tier (`Go2rtcPlayer.kt`) negotiates recvonly WebRTC straight against the dedicated go2rtc over
  its WS API (`/go2rtc/api/ws?src=<base>`, same signaling `TalkButton` speaks — both share
  `Go2rtc.kt`'s `go2rtcWsUrl`), skipping the ring-mqtt/ffmpeg hop for ~1–2 s first frame. Media
  is WebRTC to go2rtc's `:8555`; when that's unreachable (§7c host forwarder down / off-tailnet)
  the 8 s watchdog fails over to HA WebRTC and `Go2rtcHealth` (process-wide circuit-breaker)
  makes every later camera skip the tier. Shares `WebRtcCore` (process EGL/factory — never
  disposed per-session) and `LiveFrameStore` tile capture with `WebRtcPlayer`.
- **Devices v2** (`ui/devices/`): single-column list in the three-tier rhythm, PULSE segment
  chips (not stock M3), room summaries ("N devices · M on"), search, and long-press → rename/hide
  persisted in `util/DevicePrefsStore` (DataStore) with a hidden-devices shelf. Display names
  resolve rename → override → non-junk friendly_name → registry device name
  (`core/logic/Resolve.kt displayName`).
- **Control interaction model** (`ui/components/`): locks use `SlideToAct` — the drag is the
  confirmation, and the thumb holds a spinner until HA's echo (non-optimistic, per invariant 1).
  Lights/switches/fans render **optimistically** — the switch thumb follows the finger, the echo
  reconciles, and a failure snaps back (they are not security surfaces; the non-optimism invariant
  is locks/alarm only). Alarm segments are plain taps with per-segment pending spinners. Haptics
  route through the `Haptics` vocabulary (`rememberHaptics()`) — actuation tick, threshold buzz on
  the slide's commit point, reject buzz with the failure snackbar.
- Cleartext HTTP is **deliberately permitted** (`network_security_config.xml`): the HA host can
  be a bare `100.x` Tailscale IP, which a scoped domain-config cannot match. The fix is TLS on
  the proxy first (ROADMAP #1), then flip `cleartextTrafficPermitted="false"` — not a manifest
  tweak on its own.
- **Push** (`push/`) — self-hosted **ntfy**, no FCM/Google. `NtfyPushService` is a `specialUse`
  foreground service holding one streaming connection to `<base>/<topic>/json`; each frame is
  parsed (`NtfyMessage`, pure/tested), classified (`PushRoute.kindOf`: doorbell/alarm/generic),
  and raised via `PushNotifier` (per-kind channels). **Tap → deep-link:** a doorbell notification's
  `click` URL carries `?camera=camera.<base>`; `PushRoute.cameraOf` extracts it, the tap intent
  carries it (`EXTRA_CAMERA`), and `PushNav` (an app-scoped bus) hands it to the nav shell —
  which brings Home forward (`onNewIntent` covers a warm tap) and opens that camera's lightbox.
  A specific camera opens in an overlay, not a NavHost route, which is why this goes through
  `PushNav` rather than a start destination. Off by default — opt in from Settings, which requests
  `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` and offers the **battery-optimization exemption** (One UI dozes long-idle
  foreground services); `PushSettings` (DataStore) persists it; `BootReceiver` restarts the
  listener after a reboot only if enabled. The server side (ntfy Deployment + the HA doorbell/alarm
  automations that publish to it) lives in the `hawksnest-automation` repo (`docs/ntfy-push.md`).
  On-device runtime (delivery with the app closed, battery, reconnect, the tap deep-link) is the
  one part unit tests can't cover — smoke-test it on the phone.
- Suite membership: signed with the suite key (secrets are `HAWKSNEST_`-prefixed), released by
  `android-release.yml` on `android/**` pushes, tagged `android-vX.Y.Z` (clear of web `v*`).
  Managed by the Dragonfly hub for updates — but **no** SuiteConfigReader/AppAuth (nothing to
  broker; don't add them without a real reason).

## 3. Deployment (`deploy/`)

The web app ships as an nginx pod in the **same k3s cluster/namespace as HA itself** (cluster
owned by the sibling `hawksnest-automation` repo), NodePort 30080, exposed to LAN/Tailscale via
Windows portproxy scripts that run at logon (WSL IP changes each reboot).

nginx reverse-proxies `/api` to HA so the browser is same-origin. **Invariant: every HA-proxied
location must CLEAR `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Forwarded-Proto` (`proxy_set_header … ""`)** — with
`use_x_forwarded_for` and an untrusted proxy IP, HA 400s every request (this killed all camera
frames once). Not-adding XFF was enough behind a plain portproxy, but the TLS front (Tailscale
Serve, `:8443`) injects XFF and nginx passes inbound headers through, so it must be actively
stripped. Alternative: trust the flannel pod CIDR in HA — never half-do it.

`deploy.test.ts` asserts the deploy contract (nginx config, Dockerfile, NodePort) — **if you
change deploy files, that test is the spec**; update both together.

## Testing map (all real seams covered without real hardware)

- Loading/empty states across the secondary screens use the shared `Skeleton` (web) / `Modifier.shimmer`
  (Android): Rooms (connecting → room-card skeletons, empty state), History (timeline-row skeletons),
  and the camera/history-chart uses from earlier. Automations toggles render optimistically and
  "Run now" flashes a confirmation (the effect is otherwise invisible).
- `npm run test` — vitest: screens, stores, protocol, `deploy.test.ts`.
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright against **`mock-ha/`**, a scriptable fake HA speaking the real
  WebSocket protocol (auth, reconnect, doorbell, lock pending/jam/rejected flows) with a
  `/__scenario` API. The same mock serves Android instrumented tests
  (`scripts/android-emulator-test.sh`, needs KVM).
- CI: `ci.yml` (typecheck/lint/test/build + kubeconform over the k8s manifests),
  `android-ci.yml` (unit tests + assembleDebug + the advisory **Sift** design audit — a sibling
  public repo checked out by CI; known to trip on the new Compose render, advisory-only).
- Known gap: the live camera pipeline (WebRTC web / LL-HLS Android) is only ever hand-tested —
  the mock serves no `web_rtc` camera. ROADMAP #4 wants at least a written per-release smoke
  checklist.

## Invariants (security-flavored — this app unlocks doors)

1. **Locks _and the alarm_ are non-optimistic UI** — pending until HA confirms, and a failed or
   silent call surfaces an error rather than doing nothing. Deliberate; the E2E suite pins it.
   Don't "fix" the lag. Web: the alarm arm/disarm behaviour is shared by the dashboard
   `SecurityStatusBar` and the `AlarmCard` via the `useAlarmControl` hook (tapped mode spins until
   HA reaches the requested state / `triggered`, a rejected call shows an error, and a safety-net
   timeout stops a spinner the panel never answers); `LockCard` carries the same pending/error +
   timeout contract. Android: the same contract lives in `ControlGate`, and locks render as
   `SlideToAct` — the pending wait *is* the thumb holding at the end of the track. The optimistic
   switches on lights/switches/fans are **not** a violation: the invariant covers security
   domains — locks and the alarm — only.
2. **Service worker: never cache `/api`, never touch the token.**
3. **nginx XFF rule** (above) — all-or-nothing.
4. Long-lived-token auth is the accepted Phase-0 posture; the upgrade path is TLS-then-OAuth
   (ROADMAP #1–2), in that order, web + Android together so the token story stays one story.
   Android hardens token-at-rest now: the LLAT is Keystore-encrypted (`util/TokenCipher`) and
   excluded from cloud backup / device transfer, so a copied credential file is useless off-device.
5. Unknown HA domains must render, not crash (`cards.ts` contract).

## Where to make common changes

- **New device type/domain**: `src/lib/cards.ts` mapping + a card component (web);
  `core/logic` + `ui/devices` (Android). Entity naming quirks → `config/overrides.ts`.
- **HA protocol behavior**: extend `mock-ha/` first, write the failing E2E, then implement.
- **Deploy changes**: `deploy/` + `deploy.test.ts` together.
- **Automation-side features** (new sensors, Ring/Z-Wave config): wrong repo — that's
  `hawksnest-automation`; Hawksnest usually just renders the new entities via the domain mapping.
